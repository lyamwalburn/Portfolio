As part of my ongoing learning into front end development with javascript, I was inspired by the popular word game wordle to see if I could achevie a similar application that was responsive accross multipe devices.

Working in 'vannila' javascript, HTML and css I set out to acheive both the look and feel of the now iconic puzzle game. This involved creating a grid based layout for the main game to run in, handling users guesses and providing feedback for the right letter but wrong place aspect of the game.

You can play a current version of the project on the below link.

After creating the basic gameplay and functionailty of the application I wanted to see how far I could take the small project in a short ammount of time. I next set out to track the users statistics creating a basic annimated bargraph of the users success rate along with how many guesses it took them.
