Competing as part of team 'Crash Course Studios' I worked on a project to develop an application for Samsungs annual student developer challange 2013. The focus of this years task was an application targeted around samsungs note devices. For this we developed a tactics based american football game dubbed 'Super American Football'. 

With a retrofeel and vibe we aimed to create a drawing plays style gameplay which would suit the note devices S-Pen. This took full advantage of the devices capabilites and was the key focus throughout development.

The competition took place over several stages with inital 'heats' taking place at 8 univeristies accross the UK. These heats gave competitors 24 hours to create a protoype of the applicaton they intended to develop over the course of the year. At this inital stage my team finished first for Abertay universitys codeathon round.

The competition then ran throughout the year coming to the final judging in London in April 2013. Teams then gave a talk and demonstration of their application to a panel of judges. At the conclusion of this even 'Super American Football' finished in second place nation wide.
